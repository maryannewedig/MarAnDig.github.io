          We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That
          is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your
          oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty
          that surrounds the rivers we love.

          We run whitewater for the rush
        </h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">
          That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things
          after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are
          looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate
          the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
